It is Massive, ample free parking and just off the A13. The usual products but a more comprehensive range. Some other products that you wont find in the regular branches, like garden furniture. A large bakery section with some amazing ""made on the day"" items.

Plenty of staff to help navigate the store. Customer service section for buying any heavy items, they will provide assistance to your car. A brilliant branch.

People were saying more than one till should be open, there are self service tills but would rather have a cashier as trolley was full . After waiting some time I asked if another till could be opened and the reply by the 2 staff members was , they can‚Äôt it‚Äôs up to the manager , yet there were at least 3 workers standing around at the self service tills talking . I said ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt one of them get on a till as people are walking out‚Äù.  . The reply was , talk to the manager who was nowhere to be seen.If anyone was thinking of going don‚Äôt bother , as I and another lady in the queue said we won‚Äôt be back.

ChIJfRvpP_yk2EcRMHJ8P6PE448,ChIJfRvpP_yk2EcRMHJ8P6PE4481,Renan Luiz,"The 25m swimming pool is very clean, however, it  can get very busy due to swimming lessons and areas for public swimming taking over swimming lanes. Changing area normally clean, but during peak times can be a bit messy. Booking system is very easy to use and slots are always available.

The 50m swimming pool is amazing and very clean, but unfortunately they only open during weekends, morning time only. I hope this could be extended to weekdays with more time slots.

Gym is very nice as well, plenty of equipments and mostly new. Free weights area quite small but overall ok.

Overall, this leisure centre is a great option for gym, swimming and others things to keep fit.

Soft play area for kids is great, but there is a charging fee.

Staff is friendly and helpful, if you got any issues it is easy to address via email and management will reply to you.

Overall, highly recommend.",a month ago

ChIJfRvpP_yk2EcRMHJ8P6PE448,ChIJfRvpP_yk2EcRMHJ8P6PE4484,S D,"I am deeply disappointed by the current state of maintenance at this Leisure Centre. The scene that greeted me upon arrival was disheartening ‚Äì overflowing bins both at the entrance and behind the leisure centre, creating an unsightly and unhygienic environment.

What's even more concerning is that these poorly managed waste bins are located in an area frequented by children. The presence of flies buzzing around due to the overflowing bins poses a health hazard and a potential safety concern for those using the facilities.

It's disheartening to witness such negligence in maintaining a space meant for leisure and recreation. I strongly urge the management to address these issues promptly. Maintaining cleanliness and hygiene is essential not only for the well-being of the visitors but also for creating a positive and inviting atmosphere.

I hope that my feedback is taken seriously, and steps are taken to rectify the situation",5 months ago

There were no lessons last week either. No email or text communication was sent about cancelled sessions, they assumed you have read notice board in the center.

The whole experience from start to finish was faultless, the changing rooms was separate, we had a key for each to leave our stuff, a lifeguard watching the pool, a great member of staff in the pool, Jake was brilliant, he led the kids, he entertained with games, which was fun. There wasn‚Äôt many adults that wanted to get in originally until they saw it and we ended up with more than enough adults.
The ends part that Jake did with the happy birthday was out of this world.

Have to say, I'm very disappointed with this caf√© compared to its sister one in Grays. The Coronavirus protection is an absolute joke... Mask wearing not enforced - with the caf√© staff not wearing them or wearing them down to their mouths especially when cooking and serving food. No hand sanitiser whatsoever too.

In addition, the caf√© is way too cramped and the chairs are extremely noisy when moving them, especially as it's a quiet caf√©. The drinks machine was also out of order. Also, the staff were very lazy and sitting around drinking coffee.

However, I liked the food that I had, which improved the rating I gave otherwise it would have been one star.",3 years ago

Favourite item they stock right now for me is cheap sweet corn and if you like that they're just delicious especially with some olive oil and a little salt and your choice of meat. They (Morrisons) put limits on how many large salmon you can buy because when they come in they're quite spectacular especially if they've been reduced in price. Once scaled and boned and steamed or baked they are absolutely gorgeous. Who doesn't like a melt in the mouth fish? üòõ If you cook it just right it tastes like salmon mousse. I also like the fact that there are elderly in the cafe away from the hustle and bustle of walking around the busy Morrisons store. Although anyone can eat there they have that area almost completely to themselves to eat their fish and chips, their breakfast or afternoon meal, read the newspaper etc. and then go on to do other social events. It's very well organised.",3 years ago

I had my parcel delivered there for collection. The  service  i received from the  man working there on Friday 8th April 2022 afternoon was deplorable

He refused to give me my parcel and was quite dismissive, because I didn't have a code and said it was not there. Despite numerous times  asking  'Can you check? are you sure it was not delivered at 13:39PM ? because I have an email saying it's been delivered'.

He then sends me away as i am walking towards the main road  He calls me back and shows me my parcel he then persists to ask me for the code to which i tell him i have no code because yodel has not updated the deliver.  As a result my phone died  trying to get this code.he did try to help by charging it for but it was pointless because he kept picking it up telling me to call  .

I had multiple ID's and my email confirming it was me. I was in desperate need for my parcel, begging  because I had a very important wedding to attend. He had no sympathy. HE WAS ON A POWER TRIP!!!! what made it worse was that he called me back to show me my parcel,  it's taunting behaviour , i ended up have a migraine because i broke drown.

I was so angry at the situation I spoke to yodel  who confirmed the delivery process that they are simply just a delivery service , and it was the shopkeepers responsibility to have scanned my parcel once they have received it in order to update the tracking on yodel and  generate a code for me, the customer.   I do recall him being on the phone and scanning it because immediately i got a code and was able to receive my parcel.

Ultimately it was the shopkeepers fault he didn't scan at 13:39 instead 16:20,  he wasted 45 minutes of my time, and was significantly late to the wedding.

If the shop is to continue offering this service please consider training so it does not happen to anyone else .... As a customer feel free buy snacks there instead.",a year ago

Went to inflate the tires and the machine deflated the rear tires and kept erroring out  So we couldn't move the car with 2 flat tires, told the staff and they said just keep trying. Eventually after 25 mins finally got enough air in them to limp the car to the nearest kwick fit, so not only did I pay 4 the use of the air inflation but it also caused the tires to go down. Plus my friend couldn't do the tires as they cant bend. Anyway long story short. I received a parking fine ""for staying to long"" when it was the fault air pump that caused the issue, plus I was assisting my friend who couldn't do it and the car wasnt safe to move.

The fine said we exceeded the time allowed in the ‚Äúcar park‚Äù not what we were parked as we were using/queuing for all the services provided on the site.
Trying to send an appeal for this ticket was just as much of a joke as the ticket itself as we were past from pillar to post from BP to something called Motor Sure to be told neither are responsible and it‚Äôs down to euro car parks.

While there, an older man with crutches slipped on some wet tissues near the fridges in the milk/cheese aisle. There was no wet floor sign, and despite four staff members coming over, they just stood there looking at him laying on the ground very clearly not trying to even bother helping him in any way, shape or form, which seemed quite ridiculous - it was if they were watching a movie (minus the popcorn in hand)

Additionally, at the self-checkout area, there were so many tills cramped together that it was hard to see which one was free. I had to point out an available lane to the customer in front of me. Even a staff member (who was holding plastic bags like a coat hanger/statue lost in space) didn't inform the first person in the queue about an available self-checkout till which was right next to her.

I used to work for another asda store many years ago. We had proper training, product knowledge and had to offer good customer service right across the store. I have shopped at this particular store for about 5 years now, on my most recent trip to this store I was appalled by the lack of care or customer service, shown to me 2 out of the 4 times I approached staff for assistance.  The staff were dismissive and rude on 2 occasions, but must say checkout and customer service desk, spot on.Training however is needed in both the George Department and in the health and beauty aisle. George, and especially the men's, I actually had to find the packaging and the bottom and top of a pyjamas set, the sleep wear section was an absolute mess, most of the clothing department is disorganised. Which I would expect at the end of a day, but not at the beginning, at approximately 8am. I mentioned it to a member of George staff and she was very dismissive and showed no care nor offered me any assistance. Just a wave of her hand as she went past. As for health and beauty, well, I actually had to excuse myself to ask the member of staff who was suppose to be stocking the shelves on this department as she had been standing for the few minutes before i approached, chin wagging with a ""friend/customer"". My enquiry was rudely cut short by the friend telling me to go checkout to make my enquiry, to which the staff member just echoed what her friend had said. I pointed out as I walked away how rude they both were, neither could have heard as they had returned to their chin wagging/conversation. Asda was once a supermarket that offered a high standard of customer service, no wonder they are no longer voted retailer of the year.

Because the food is absolutely outstanding every time.

You tell me, where in London can you get a giant pork chop, gravy, onions, peas, roast potatoes and mushrooms for under ¬£10.00.

The set Menu price is ONLY  ¬£7.50, and you can add your favourite veggies.

New Atlas Cafe is a small family run business, like many of the old traditional London cafes selling traditional English food, they are in danger of completely dying out because London is swamped by the Franchise Cafes.

But you can‚Äôt get Double Egg and Chips in Costa, or an absolutely gigantic Full English Breakfast, Sausage, eggs, bacon, beans and toast, at Pret ! All for around ¬£6.00 !

This Cafe is Special, they‚Äôve been serving Traditional English Food for Over 40 years, and prices unseen in 2023.

I‚Äôve been having my Lamb Chops, onions, chips, peas, and Gravy in here for over 30 years and I plan to continue having my Roast Dinners here for many more years.

Support the old London Cafes and have a Full English Breakfast here, or a full Sunday Roast Dinner for around ¬£7.50 each.

Breakdown of my Lunch yesterday, grand total for two people only ¬£20.00 for both lunches:

The showers don‚Äôt have any space to put your stuff! It‚Äôs basically just the space for the shower. I have read this online before in some reviews but never thought it was so small!! Then the water was not that hot which was very unpleasant because I arrived very late that night and I just wanted a hot shower! Plus the cold room after! I had to sleep with all the clothes that I had in my backpack! In the morning I complained about this and the employee at the reception said they would take care of it. I just stayed for one night.
Plus a guy in my room snored all night! It was horrible!!
Also there is no kitchen in this hostel, even not just a small one if you want to do some coffee or tea. I didn‚Äôt know that! There should be a small area available at least!
I asked for a mug and a spoon and an employee went to get it.

ChIJM4cpDTobdkgRx8LDQJ76Yu8,ChIJM4cpDTobdkgRx8LDQJ76Yu83,Ruby Cleve,"This hostel would have been better had it not been for the inaccessibility for my friend who is a wheelchair user. We called ahead and specifically asked if they had accessible rooms. They said they did so we trusted it was accessible as also advertised on their website.

Our room was in an isolated room on the basement level (Room 10, level 0), with bad lighting and it was cold. The room was 4 people, 2 bunks and very very small space for the wheelchair, which had to be confined to the corner and allowed for very minimal movement. We asked three times to upgrade to perhaps a more accessible room or a private room but were denied because they were completely booked out. No effort was made on behalf of the staff to accommodate this issue, no refund or price reduction were offered and apparently no concern shown. Only the Aussie bloke at reception was helpful and suggested that we come to reception at 7-8am to see if there were any cancellations.

There were also steps everywhere in the common area so we had to ask people to lift up the wheelchair.

The lift was not very efficient for the amount of foot traffic. My friend would wait upwards of 10 minutes just to get to the floor above.

Also on the last day the accessible entrance door was broken from the inside.

Other than that the food was really good and the shower / bathroom was very accessible. Also it was in a good location.

Just wish they would be more transparent about their accessibility rather than claiming to be fully accessible.",a month ago

The service staff was efficient and very busy. I think it was pricey for the overall afternoon tea experience. I think that for one to fully enjoy and appreciate afternoon tea, it must be a multisensory experience, that is, the food tastes and smells good and is visually pleasing, and the atmosphere of the place draws one's energy towards attending to the food and the people we are enjoying them with.

We started our afternoon with a glass of fresh, crisp Cremant, the understated but brilliant and brighter cousin of Champagne. We enjoyed it so much, we order another round. Which was followed by tea.
The tea is Mariage Freres, on both occasions I opted for the French Breakfast which has a slight malty undertone that compliments the food.

The sandwiches are made fresh, with the softest bread and spread with rich, tasty butter.  The selection was traditional cucumber, smoked salmon, egg and cress with a seasonal turkey sandwich. All delicate, all delicious.

The scones, warm and crumbly and the cakes have the right level of sweetness. On my most recent visit, we had an eclair, a small cake and a luxurious meringue.

Now the staff, well, I cannot say how wonderful and accommodating they are on both visits. The restaurant is very welcoming to dog owners, however my guest is allergic to them, so without hesitation or fuss, they moved us swiftly, giving us a choice of different tables.

I will DEFINITELY BE BACK.

The reason I scored 4 for the atmosphere because we were given a table outside. When I booked it through Google it did not state that we will be outside. The staff were very good to move us to a table underneath a heater but not all tables have heaters. So book directly via their website to sit inside.",2 months ago

From the moment I walked in, I was struck by the welcoming ambiance and modern yet cozy decor. The restaurant exudes a warm and inviting atmosphere that's perfect for a memorable meal. The staff was not only friendly but also attentive, ensuring that every aspect of our dining experience was exceptional.

Now, let's talk about the food ‚Äì it was nothing short of a culinary delight! The menu boasts a creative fusion of flavors and ingredients, and each dish was a work of art. The quality of the ingredients was evident, and the presentation was simply stunning. Whether you're a fan of seafood, poultry, or vegetarian options, The Table Cafe has something to satisfy every palate.

I also appreciated their commitment to sourcing locally and using fresh, seasonal ingredients. It's evident that they take pride in their craft, and it truly shines through in the dishes they serve.

The Table Cafe is more than just a restaurant; it's an experience. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply looking for a memorable meal, I highly recommend giving it a try. It's a culinary journey that you won't soon forget!",3 months ago

The good:
- Food was delicious. The wine list was diverse.
- Setting was great including the lights and music.
- Location

The bad:
-In total, 5 waiters/waitresses served us. When serving the meal, the waiter needed to confirm what we had ordered, since the order was taken by another waiter. This is why we didn't feel like getting personal service. The waiters were really attentive, however they seemed unauthentic and simply performing their duty. Fortunately, the last waitress serving us felt authentic.
-Overall, the atmosphere was busy, although there were quite many personnel serving customers. The feeling to us was that we were wanted to eat and leave quickly, to make room for the next clients
-The table side was not wiped properly, as it felt sticky.

We would have loved to get a slightly more authentic and unhurried service.",a week ago

I have eaten in this cafe many times and I've always enjoyed the food, I have not had any issues.
HOWEVER I will not be returning here (although I live just 2 minute walk away)
I came in with my two young children one Sunday afternoon, we arrived at 12 but by the time we had chosen our food it was 12.10. My daughter really wanted the French toast but we was told this was not possible as the menu it is on has 'stopped' at 12 due to there being two separate menus and the kitchen couldn't keep up with that! I understand if it was busy but there was only us and a few other people (who were already eating) , it was only french toast for a small child! - Bad Customer Service!

Brilliant customer service-
We decided to leave, we went to Saucy Sausage in the high street, where we ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream, but they had no whipped cream.(This was absolutely fine, just as happy with a plain hot chocolate)
The staff member took it upon himself and went out of his way to the shops next door to buy cream and Marshmallows to give it that little bit extra! This is my eyes is brilliant customer service and what it is all about.

This was an uber eats order. The portion size is so small. The presentation is so sloppy and because the cafe do not know how to pack for a delivery the beans came out the sides of the boxes.

From looking at the other review photos I hope the cafe can learn a thing or two about presentation and even the quality of their food being served because nothing about this breakfast was tasty.

I mean, how can you serve food to your customers with bean sauce dripping from the plate. The egg was the worst egg I've tasted and just from the photo you can see this portion is just unacceptable.

Please consider ordering sectioned containers or send beans in a separate container like other local cafes do. Also consider wrapping your boxes with cling film to avoid spillages.

Please don't pass blame on your delivery drivers and please don't even waste your time responding to my review, just take on board what has been said, do some research to improve your business and overall, do better.

When challenged on this, the cafe said they could do nothing except for us to contact uber eats to try and get a part refund.

Very friendly to everyone who walked in and out - they seem to know a lot of people in the area.

My biggest gripe is the language barrier, I wanted to order 2x burger and chips and instead I was served what the cook recommended which was chicken pieces, chips and salad for ¬£10.90 each. I was hoping to enjoy my burger and chips for ¬£4.60 each.. But okay. I like to think I was pretty clear by saying ""I'll stick with my burger and chips"" to only then be served something else was a bit surprising. A happy accident I guess? Either way, not the end of the world.

The food was somewhat decent, although halfway through eating my food, I noticed there were multiple hairs in my salad.

I would have said the prices weren't bad but considering I didn't get the thing I ordered and that there was a hair in my food I'm going to have to say otherwise.

ChIJ2TGVnjEHdkgRIAhxj6LcQKA,ChIJ2TGVnjEHdkgRIAhxj6LcQKA5,Albert,"Just a short review with some quick positives and negatives:

Negatives

1) Overly-pushy manager (?) who was trying to hard sell a small ‚Äòrejuvenation‚Äô drink allegedly full of healthy ingredients ‚Äì which suspiciously smelled and tasted of orange with a little apple juice in it ‚Äì for over ¬£4

2) We were over-charged (partly my fault for not checking and questioning at the time)

3) A muffin which, honestly, the McDonald‚Äôs around the corner would be disappointed selling

4) The female member of staff who seemed to be bothered by us looking at the menu and spending a little time deciding on what to eat

Positives

1) Garlic fries were decent enough (although deep fried and it would have been good for this to be mentioned on the menu)

Overall

Don‚Äôt bother. There is a bad vibe about the staff, the food is poor and over-priced, you‚Äôll get the hard sell and, looking at other reviews, you‚Äôll probably get over-charged. I will never be eating there again.",8 months ago
ChIJNQzkGBYHdkgRQer4GIung1E,ChIJNQzkGBYHdkgRQer4GIung1E1,Victoria Breslin,"After seeing the other 5 star reviews I'm very disappointed.  Service was slow and the staff were seemingly unaware of the order of the queue. I didn't feel particularly listened to. The coffee is very bitter, even with syrup in - so maybe ok if that's what you like, but not great for a smooth cappuccino or latte. I didn't finish it.
The food on the counter looked fresh and there was a range of hot and cold food.
However the person nearest me had her hot crossing arrive burnt.
Although the cafe is obviously inside a store, the atmosphere is chilled with relaxing music and feels separate from the shoppers. Soft lighting would be much better here for tired shoppers to relax though - it's so bright!
Unfortunately the toilets are not well maintained and I would only recommend using them if desperate.",a year ago

Staff are nice and reasonably attentive, the push button for service is great, and I enjoyed the cocktails.

I found the coffee of a very good quality (same as the one at Dunkin' Donuts). The place is not well managed as there is thieves coming every other day and stealing a sandwich or a yoghurt without been caught. I've seen it 6 times. Apart from this there is two negative factors, one is that the only toilet is always busy. Taking into consideration the location of this caff√© (a few metres from the train station) expect queues for the toilet at all times. The other negative element is the staff, I believe most of them are young girls whom seem to be not friendly and polite enough. One of them shouldn't be facing customers at all because she doesn't understand the worst 'customer service'. Instead she should be working as a prison warden. For the past 3 years I never heard a ""how are you"" question coming out from their mouths or any other welcoming expression. I don't think it's too difficult to show a bit more of empathy with people. They are most of the times unfriendly, bitter, sarcastic, cheeky, sulky. A person like me doesnt deserve such a poor level service but they are too ignorant to understand this. I always felt not welcome, like if I had killed someone. Anyway I used to go there because I liked the coffee. Not anymore. Sorry. If I look for great customer service I rather prefer to go to 222.",4 years ago

Having navigated the endless process to register online for a reader's ticket, I arrived, to be told at the ground floor desk that bags were not allowed (fine; I had none) and otherwise to go to the first floor. Which I did. On the first floor,  I went to the entrance for the Document Room (which was where I had been informed previously that my booking was, to review the documents  I had requested) where I was told that I had first to go to another desk, in order for my reader ticket to be created (who knew? There were no notices or directions anywhere from which this information could have been gleaned). Having done this, I returned to the entrance to the Document Room, where I was now told that outdoor coats were not allowed inside, and I would have to go back downstairs to leave my coat in a cloakroom - when I suggested that I could have been told this when I had first gone to the ground floor reception desk, the reply I got was that the staff at the two desks work for different organisations, and any idea that they might communicate in order to improve the customer experience was unthinkable. I went downstairs, and eventually I located a cloakroom, where I emptied my coat pockets of all the things I would need for my visit, to carry them instead by hand, and I presented myself again at the entrance to the Document Room. Finally - entrance was allowed! I and my colleague presented ourselves at the document retrieval desk, where it transpired that my documents were upstairs in the Map Room, whilst his, a related file, were in the Document Room. When we suggested that since both of the requested files were of interest to both of us it would be helpful if we could both look together at both files, we were told that this was impossible since all the other places at the table in the Document Room at which my colleague's place was reserved had been taken, there would be no space for me; in the event, I went with him anyway, and in the yawning and sparsely populated vastness of the document room we found that in fact all of the other places on his table were gloriously empty (like most of the rest of the room). And so, I could always have gone there, anyway.
Having finished with that file, we returned it, and we made our way upstairs to the Map Room. At the entrance to which I was now told that I could not take my spectacle case into the Map Room; although, generously, I would be allowed to have my spectacles with me. Faced with the prospect of going all the way back to the ground floor cloakroom in order to deposit my spectacle case with my coat, I decided instead that dealing with the rules and the staff in this place is just more trouble than it's worth. And so, I left - before I could run into any more petty and arbitrary rules that nobody had thought it appropriate to flag in advance (What next? No footwear, maybe, or belts or any metal objects having to be removed?)
The people who run this place have clearly lost the plot, and it seems to be run for the convenience of the staff over and above any considerations of utility for members of the public.

The Italian restaurant offers an exceptional dining experience, from the welcoming staff to the delicious food.
The friendly and welcoming staff is always a great way to start a dining experience. The restaurant places a high value on customer satisfaction, which is always a great sign.
The special starter mushrooms in tomato sauce with cheese sounds like a great way to start a meal. The combination of mushrooms, tomato sauce, and cheese creates a rich and savoury flavour. However, I am not a fan of tomato sauce, so if you are in the same boat as me, consider ordering something else.
The Ravioli alla Carbonara is a delicious main course. The combination of stuffed pasta with guanciale and creamy eggs in a Parmesan sauce topped with crispy pancetta sounds like a perfect blend of flavours and textures. The parmesan sauce can sometimes be salty, but I enjoyed the dish.
Lastly, the Tiramis√∫ al Pistacchio is the perfect way to end the meal. Pistachio mascarpone cream, coffee, and Savoyard biscuit create a delicious and unique twist on the classic tiramisu.

It‚Äôs so nice either in a wrap (normally with bacon and cheese) or on a plate with chips and a wide range of sauces to compliment it.

Mehmet also makes a really good coffee. Whether it‚Äôs latte (hot or iced), cappuccino, mocha/mochacinno or even a standard flat white or espresso. All as good as, if not better than most high street coffee shops.

ChIJuxIO6RofdkgRByQ9t1LxgBo,ChIJuxIO6RofdkgRByQ9t1LxgBo1,a h,"I recently visited the Starbucks located inside Sainsbury's, and while the drinks were as good as always, I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the seating area. The tables were dirty, and the fabric of the seats had numerous stains that clearly indicated a lack of cleaning for quite some time.

Let's start with the positive aspects of my visit. As expected, the drinks at Starbucks were delicious. The baristas were friendly and efficient, ensuring that my order was made exactly to my liking. Whether it was a classic latte or a refreshing frappuccino, the quality and taste were excellent, upholding the standard Starbucks is known for.

However, the state of the seating area left a lot to be desired. The tables were visibly dirty, with crumbs and spills that hadn't been properly wiped down. It was disappointing to see as cleanliness is essential, especially during these times when hygiene is of utmost importance.

The fabric of the seats was the most concerning aspect. It was evident that they hadn't been cleaned in a long time, as various stains were clearly visible. This lack of cleanliness made me question the overall hygiene standards of the establishment. It was off-putting to sit on seats that appeared to have not been cleaned for years.

While I understand that Starbucks c/o Sainsbury's is a busy location, it is crucial for the management to prioritize regular cleaning and maintenance to ensure a pleasant experience for customers. Dirty tables and stained seats can significantly affect the overall impression of the store.

Despite these cleanliness issues, the friendly and efficient service from the Starbucks staff was commendable. The drinks were of the usual high standard, and the store itself had a cozy ambiance. However, it is crucial for the management to address the cleanliness concerns in order to maintain customer satisfaction and uphold the reputation of the Starbucks brand.

In conclusion, my experience at Starbucks c/o Sainsbury's was a mixed one. While the drinks and service were satisfactory, the lack of cleanliness in the seating area, particularly the dirty tables and stained seats, was disappointing. I hope that the management takes immediate action to address these concerns and maintain a higher standard of hygiene in the future.",6 months ago

The first stop was the loo, which was disgusting, not very clean, and dirty toilets.
Then into the cinema. I made sure we were early so I could sit comfortably.
The seats were rigid and did not recline. So, according to the website, The London Swiss Cottage and Greenwich Imax both have comfortable luxe recline seats with footrests.
However, we were shocked! They have standard hard seats and no recline. What a shame!
When we'd sat through the seemingly never-ending adverts and trailers for inane films, my mood was darkening.
Plus, the Oppenhermier film is a long run (3 hours movie), so we've chosen this cinema to make ourselves comfortable for the extended 3 hours.

What a bad experience, we felt betrayed. We paid for something we didn't get.

Updated in response to Harps - the last time I visited was 23/12/23 around late afternoon. The lady was an Indian woman in her 50s working at the trolley self service who was very rude. My product needed approval so I patiently waited for her while she served another customer. Another lady waiting in the queue pointed out I was waiting. The Asda staff turned and shouted at me to ask someone else. There was noone else around.

Previous time to that was back in September or October, I used the trolley self service as 1. My basket was incredibly full and 2. There were available tills and 3. No signs to say basket shoppers can't use trolley lane.
Another Indian lady (i can't remember what she looks like but recall she had some coloured highlights in her hair) was incredibly rude to me, talking aggressively and telling me I wasn't allowed to use the trolley self service. But at the same time was serving another customer who also had a basket shop with fewer products and didn't say anything to them. I raised this with the duty manager who was pretty incompetent too.

I am extremely disappointed with the service provided! It was my second time shopping with this store, and the experience has left me so annoyed.

I initially booked express delivery and selected a time slot. When my order was running late and hadn't even left for delivery, I reached out to customer service. The representative informed me that my delivery would arrive by the end of the day (which is not express). However, to my surprise, I later discovered that my order had been canceled. I contacted customer service once more, and they advised me to contact the express delivery company to reorder, as the cancellation was not initiated by Asda. I was provided with a contact number.
Upon calling the delivery driver, he mentioned that he was at the store but couldn't locate my order. He advised me to contact Asda since he couldn't take any action. When I reached out to Asda again, the representative was helpful in resolving the issue, reinstating my order, and even offered a free delivery as an apology for the inconvenience (eventually I was charged ¬£8.50 again). I was given a new time slot between 16:00-17:00.
However, by 17:15, my order had still not been delivered. I called customer service once more, and they informed me that my order was ready and waiting for the driver. Finally, my delivery arrived, but the ordeal was far from over.
Upon unpacking my shopping, I realized that several items were missing. I contacted customer service again, only to be told that I could request a refund once the order was marked as delivered. Unfortunately, I still couldn't report all my missing items because my order hadn't been marked as delivered yet (19:30pm)

This experience has been incredibly draining and frustrating. What should have been a straightforward online shopping experience turned into a day-long ordeal. This is my second highly frustrating experience with this store, and I will definitely avoid it in the future. No more shopping with Asda for me.

Update!!!
At 21:35, I received an email confirming the delivery, which finally allowed me to request a refund for the 14 missing items. Can you believe the response I got? ""Your Asda refund request: not approved."" I'm absolutely fuming!
I've called customer service for the 9th time, and they informed me that my case would be escalated to the financial department. They promised a response within 24-48 hours, but if not, I'll have to call them again.
I want to make it clear that I won't allow anyone to take my money unfairly, whether it was the person packing my shopping or the driver. I refuse to support theft or be a

I can understand she is new but her behaviour while handling the customer is not very decent. When I ordered my coffee she forgot to give me my change and directly went to talk to her colleagues. When I asked about my change she ignored me and  when my drink was served. I asked her once again about my change without being sorry or anything. She deliberately placed the change on the table.

The staff‚Äôs attitude was concerning, as they seemed more focused on closing up rather than providing quality customer service. It was disheartening to witness their rudeness and lack of consideration.

To make matters worse, the quality of everything we ordered was noticeably off. From the food to the beverages, it was evident that attention to detail was lacking. What‚Äôs more, the wait time to be served was surprisingly long, leaving us frustrated and eager to finally place our orders.

Even after enduring the wait and placing our orders, we were dismayed to find out that a significant portion of the food options listed were unavailable. This, we were told, was due to the staff‚Äôs priority of closing right at 4 PM. Such a situation made us feel like an inconvenience rather than valued customers.

Overall, my visit to the Tesco Cafe was a letdown. The combination of rude staff, subpar quality, extended wait times, and limited food choices left me with a negative impression. I hope that the management takes this feedback seriously and works towards improving the customer experience, ensuring that others do not face the same disappointing encounter.",4 months ago

After paying 7 pounds for each meal, we all left, including my 6 year old sister, hungry after only being able to eat a few chips. After taking it up with the staff I was told that I could not be refunded because we had tasted the food. How could we know it was spicy without tasting it. The menu mentioned nothing about spice, it just said chicken strips and chips. After asking the staff what I should have done, they told me we shouldn't have tried it. We tried to return the food that was so spicy we couldn't touch it and we're told we shouldn't have tasted it. My youngest sister tried one and came home crying.

We had the entire building to ourselves which was great to spread out to get ready, serve drinks and mingle as well as entertain kids in a separate area while the main auditorium was turned around between ceremony, dinner service and party. While we were not too involved in the logistics as we were lucky to have a wedding planner, everything went smoothly and without a hitch. All our guests were impressed with the venue and we were almost happy about the pouring rain on the day which only added to the atmosphere!

Wilton Music Hall is I think the oldest music hall in London. Reminiscint of the old TV series The Good Old Days. A fine historic building.

Saw The Merchant of Venice 1936. Which brings the Shakespeare play up-to-date against the rise of the British Fascists under Oswald Moseley between the wars. And the historic battle of cable street which occurred on the streets outside the hall. Where the good people of the east end, English, Irish Catholics, dockers, the African community stood with their Jewish neighbours to resist the black shirts of Moseley. A play sadly relevant today against the pretext of Palestinian rights demonstrations support the Hamas party which has denied the Gazan people the vote since 2008

A worthwhile play which is touring England.

ChIJr6-6s1EbdkgRwChbpZiwqqA,ChIJr6-6s1EbdkgRwChbpZiwqqA3,Christopher D,"We went for afternoon tea and it is honestly one of the most underwhelming experiences I've had living in London.

The food was insultingly meagre for the price and didn't taste as you would expect either; offering dreadful value for money.

I opted for the 'Hearty Treats' menu and it is completely mis-sold. I received a single pig in blanket, the toastie was the size of less than half a standard sandwich and the other two items were also of no substance.

My partner had the finger sandwiches which tasted very salty and were again unsubstantial.

It is standard practice that guests receive replenishments at afternoon tea, however when we requested this we had to ask two more times until we got an answer; where we were told this would not be possible. How can you take people's hard earned money and give them so little in return? For reference I'm a tall man with slender build (78kg), and average appetite which was left entirely unsatisfied.

The deserts were disappointing too; each one barely a mouthful - with a Christmas pudding flavoured macaroon (who's idea was that?!), a bland strawberry Swiss roll and minuscule entremet that had melted by the time it was served - again rather bland. The scones were rather dense but tasted fine.

Having been to afternoon tea at the Zetter, we felt cheated and cannot recommend it. Save your money and go to the one in the National Gallery - similarly priced, great views and even better food. Fortnum and Mason's also offer a superior afternoon tea that's more affordable than the Zetter, which is effectively charging over ¬£50 for two pots of tea, 5 small cakes and a sandwich in a gloomy setting.

Entrance - Definitely a hidden gem, from the outside it does not look like it would have that much space on the inside which was a lovely surprise. Bright and yellow!

Food - For the price that you pay, the food is mediocre. Defo an extortion. You could get more value at a local cafe.

I ordered the small fry breakfast and the bacon was stale, beans were cold and egg was undercooked - for 9 pounds sterling lol

Drinks - I ordered a lemonade a homemade lemonade and a juice shot - ¬£3 for a tiny shot of juice and I can‚Äôt remember how much the lemonade was but I could not finish it.

Decor - It was giving retro diner in the 70s‚Ä¶ without sounding mad if I was a black person in the 70s n saw a restaurant that was decorated like that - I‚Äôm doing the biggest U Turn - on one hand I thought my gosh this decor is giving ‚ÄòWhites Only‚Äô vibes and on the other hand I thought maybe that‚Äôs their target audience- who knows. It was nice, just creeped me out a bit.

Cleanliness - Very clean and tidy, could not fault it.

Cost - ¬£19 in total for a small fry up, a drink and a juice shot - again - if you want proper food go to your local cafe you‚Äôll get it for half the price

Customer service - Luca was extremely attentive and made the experience lovely! Anything I needed he was always there - thank you Luca you‚Äôre a credit to the restaurant.

Overall - 5/10 - probably wouldn‚Äôt return based on my comments above but it could‚Äôve been worse and I‚Äôm fairly picky! Lol

From the delectable food to the exceptional service, every aspect of our visit exceeded expectations.

First and foremost, the food at Manicomio was simply outstanding. We decided to indulge in their coffee and pasta offerings, and we were not disappointed. The pasta dishes were cooked to perfection, with flavors that danced harmoniously on our palates. Each bite was a delightful symphony of taste and texture, leaving us craving for more. The attention to detail in the preparation and presentation of the dishes was evident, showcasing the chef's expertise and passion for culinary excellence.

What truly set Manicomio apart was the impeccable service. The staff members were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They made us feel welcomed from the moment we stepped in and catered to our every need throughout our three-hour visit. It was refreshing to experience such genuine warmth and professionalism, which added an extra layer of enjoyment to our dining experience.

Although the restaurant offers outside seating, we opted to sit inside due to the slightly chilly summer weather. The interior ambiance was cozy and inviting, with tasteful decor that complemented the overall dining experience. While I can imagine the outside seating being wonderful during warmer months, the comfortable indoor environment ensured we could fully savor our meal without any discomfort.

In conclusion, Manicomio restaurant left a lasting impression on me with its remarkable food, exemplary service, and delightful atmosphere. Whether you're a coffee lover, a pasta enthusiast, or simply seeking a memorable culinary adventure, this establishment will surely exceed your expectations.

We hadn't finished it and the waiter came to take the plate?? As in rushing us to finish it, didn't make any sense to be honest.
Then the mains lacked a bit of flavour in my opinion, I had the carbonara and it lacked a lot of flavour in my humble (not Italian) opinion and the seafood pasta was bleak.
Me and my partner had finished and our friend was still eating when the waiter came again and stood next to us waiting for my friend to finish the 3 tortellini she had left to quickly take her plate???

It was a great experience, lovely and perfectly done poached eggs. I believe they came from a farm, because they were very nutritious and even it looks like a small portion, together with the sourdough bread, it kept us full for a long while.

Being a Yank, I drink diet coke and they made sure to have some cold for me for breakfast after the 1st day. And the breakfast, whether Continental or ala carte, was great!

As has been said before, it was on a quiet street off Earls Court Road and close to buses and the Tube. There were several good(and a couple of not so good) pubs and restaurants nearby.

The only thing I would say is that if you are going to stay for a bit longer than the typical folks we saw there, 2-3/4 nights, is that it would have been nice to have a chest to put clothes away vs shelves. If you are not staying as long as we did, which may have set a record, then you will really appreciate the care and friendliness and cleanliness of this lovely boutique hotel!!

The hotel's elegant and sophisticated atmosphere, combined with its impeccable service, made for an unforgettable experience.

As I was seated at my table, I was presented with an extensive tea menu, featuring a wide selection of teas from around the world. I decided to go for the traditional English Breakfast tea to accompany my food.

The food arrived shortly after presented beautifully on a tiered stand. The bottom tier featured a variety of sandwiches, including cucumber & cream cheese, smoked salmon & dill, egg mayonnaise & cress and their signature (my fav) chicken mayonnaise and toasted almonds. Each sandwich was freshly made and tasted delicious.

On the top tier was an array of sweet treats, including a selection of cakes and pastries. My favourites were the hazelnut creme choux pastry and the toffee apple tart, both of which were beautifully presented and tasted amazing.

Finally, I was presented with warm, freshly baked scones, served with clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam. The scones were perfectly baked, with a crispy exterior and a soft and fluffy interior.

Throughout my meal, the service was exceptional. The staff were attentive, polite and knowledgeable, and made me feel very welcome.

Overall, the Afternoon Tea at Milestone Hotel was a truly wonderful experience. The food was delicious, the tea was perfect, and the service was outstanding. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Halal British Afternoon Tea experience.

As you entered the cinema, the staff were friendly and helpful and asked if you required food, self-service to hand and provided the food very quickly.

The layout seemed clean, with plenty of items to choose from, relatively straightforward!

In terms of travelling, both the district line runs through East Putney and have the mainline station, Putney. If you want to park, make sure you have the Ring Go app, and after 18:30, it's free, relatively easy off-road parking all around the area.

The seating within the cinema was a great experience, updated and you could move your seats back and see the new Batman film, which was great but a long film perfect for the setting.

As a professional musician who  played on the soundtrack for this particular movie, I feel is it very unprofessional from the staff of Odeon not allow the audience to sit through the complete screening/credits.

And when I went down to check, I found my stuffs at the shower place, exactly where I had left them the night before.

Another incident I remember I was new in swimming and was about to drown, and almost instantly two life savers responded with lifebouys. They were very helpful and even guided me a bit on the basics of swimming and now I love chilling there after work.

He said that he would come here whenever he feels a bit homesick. And it did not disappoint. I had some Red Beetroot soup, as sharers we went for two varieties of Pierogis, and as a main the potato pancakes with creamy mushroom sauce that comes with a side salad. As dessert some had the apple pie with vanilla ice cream and some had another round of their ""Warmup tea with orange, cloves, cinnamon and honey"". The size of all the dishes were very generous.

Autograf is a smaller restaurant but provides the atmosphere that felt like the perfect spot to catch up with dear friends and family over some good meals with a team at site that is very friendly. We will surely come back.",a month ago

ChIJvZQfDrIbdkgROCFmyEkSgcs,ChIJvZQfDrIbdkgROCFmyEkSgcs3,Joss,"What a disappointment. This isn't at all the pub I came to love less than a year ago.
For context, before I lived in Archway I used to visit this place once a month for over a year. It was the closest pub to the Premier Inn where I would stay. I loved that it was always the same faces behind the bar and I even became friendly with some of the regulars. It was a warm, welcoming environment. Great beer, poured professionally. The atmosphere was also great. I loved their Monday night live music.
I can't lie. Apart from the fact they didn't do food, this was genuinely my favourite pub in London and one of the reasons I was so happy to move to Archway.
But in the months since living here, I've been to the tavern a handful of times and every experience has been awful. For two weeks I came and there was no beer on tap, and one time there was not even any wine. I was told by the stressed staff to come back on Wednesday or Thursday if I wanted the full selection. So I did, but we came on the night of the quiz. It was aggressively invasive for those of us not competing and too miserable outside to escape the noise. We finished our poorly poured beers and left. A week later I returned to be served by the same man who was hosting the quiz. He poured me another bad beer. Absolutely no idea. Where did all the staff who knew how to pour beer go? I don't recognise any of these faces.
The last time I came I waited almost 10 minutes at an empty bar to be served. Finally, another staff member who I had never seen before came out. No apology. No character of warmth. Again, a terrible pour. This place has become miserable. I can't think of any reason to come back now. Thank God there are other pubs in the area.",a month ago

ChIJ6UsHgRgTdkgRvYUNfn72MZw,ChIJ6UsHgRgTdkgRvYUNfn72MZw2,Sheikhh Smith,"I recently visited Costa Coffee in South Harrow and it was a delightful experience. From the moment I walked in, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee set a welcoming tone. The baristas greeted me with warm smiles, despite the busy morning rush.

I ordered a flat white, and it was prepared to perfection ‚Äì just the right balance of espresso and milk, with a beautiful latte art heart on top. The pastries seemed just as tempting, so I indulged in a croissant that was flaky and buttery, a perfect companion to my coffee.

The cafe‚Äôs atmosphere was cozy, with comfortable seating and an ambiance that encouraged me to linger over my coffee. It was clean and well-maintained, with attention to COVID-19 safety protocols, which made me feel safe.

In terms of value, the prices were on par with what you‚Äôd expect from a high-street coffee shop, and the quality certainly matched the cost. It‚Äôs a spot I‚Äôd recommend to anyone looking for a coffee break in South Harrow, and I‚Äôm already planning my next visit to try some of the other items on the menu.

Rating: 5 stars for excellent coffee, delectable treats, and a welcoming atmosphere.

I think the experience is much better if you don't have to drive around, struggling to find a parking space, as there's no car park available for customers only, and the couple of spaces right in front of the entrance are taken.

There's an area for small children, where they can play with appropriate toys. Toddlers under 1 might get bored quickly, though.

A tiny caf√© on the spot offers a coffee from a coffee machine, but nothing artisan or professional. Light snacks available as well as bigger meals like all day breakfast or a selection of sandwiches and paninis.

I asked politely when is it going to be fixed and he told me he doesn't know (but his reaction was as if I've disturbed him with such a silly question), only telling me maybe tomorrow, maybe later. What kind of answer is that towards a customer? Tonight (and again it's not the first time with the same employee) at 10:30 PM I was refused by him to refuel my vehicle, because the CCTV couldn't see the first letter of my registration number. I've been refuelling at the same place day or night, several days per week and I didn't encounter any problem with the CCTV or any other employer. There were other customers, refuelling in the same time as me, and they weren't refused. So why was I refused, when the number plate has the same dize, font style and colour as all vehicles from England. In my opinion this is discrimination towards myself from that employer and I don't even know him. For this I won't come here again never and I'm bery, but very dissapointed.",5 years ago

The last 4 or 5 visits - and I visit often - the screens haven‚Äôt been cleaned, aisles of rubbish incl nacho trays, cups and empty bags with the screen stinking of the remains of the last screen. The screens are somewhat well kept but the projectionists have been slacking in making sure once the film starts the format fits the screen in ratio. The staff are dependent on whose on the rota that day; some are on it and some say ‚Äútoilets will be sorted‚Äù ‚Äúscreens being cleaned so wait a few moments and go in at the start time‚Äù and the toilets will have 2 awfully damaged yet operational and unclean cubicles out of 5 and 10 broken urinals, and also you‚Äôll never be notified when the screen is ready and go in and it‚Äôll still be trashed. What I will say is they‚Äôve stepped up on security which is appreciated as I‚Äôve not had a film disrupted by another person in a month or two which I find this cinema Kn particular can be notorious for. So big thanks for having proper operating security loops.

Listen; cinema outings are an expensive trip now and when you pay a certain amount a month on limitless you expect to get your moneys worth. The food is already expensive but you can take in your own discreetly.

Today I ordered my coffee and I saw the barista pick up a shot of (old) coffee which was sitting on the side and watched him pour it in my cup. I asked if I could have a fresh shot of coffee as I have just paid ¬£3.50 and don't expect someone else's old coffee, in response the employee said it was fresh and continued to carry on making it. As soon as I tasted it I could tell it was stale.
Very annoyed at the decline of service from your company. The standard from shop to shop is so varried that there is no consistency whatsoever.

The staff is always so warm and welcoming. Always taking care of my needs and working with professionalism.

I had the chance to grab a coffee and go, but also to have breakfast and afternoon tea there. And every time, I was treated very nicely and the food was always delicious and very fresh.

To be completely honest, all the drinks and coffee are made with great quality and attention to detail. But it truly doesn't compare with the quality of humanity shown by the staff. The care, love and passion they bring to their customers is something very rare to find nowadays. And I think that's what makes a place different than the others. The products are important but secondary. The most important factor is the people. And here the people are a 10 out of 10. That makes this place unique.",4 months ago

Subsequently, she engaged in unwarranted gossip with fellow staff members, leading to disparaging looks from the entire crew, including a bold gentleman. Moreover, she raised her voice at me without clear cause. Notably, another staff member, while referring to me as the lady with the headscarf, indulged in gossip with a customer. This experience highlights a significant need for improved customer service training and professionalism among the staff.

I placed an order on 30/06/19 for a few boxes of Modo Mio pods, after not receiving them for a few days I enquired as to what was happening twice via email, to which I received no response.

This week I phoned and spoke to a very friendly lady (Lorraine) who apologised for the delay, explaining the pods had been sent back to their warehouse as there was an issue with my address....nobody at Lavazza had the courtesy to tell me about this! More on this further down!

This was on Monday July 8th, I was advised they will leave with Royal Mail that afternoon...and still I'm waiting for my pods, it's now July 15th by this point.

I've tried all morning through to this afternoon to phone and nobody is picking up, have now emailed again, which I expect will also be ignored. I'm in two minds to cancel the order but I fear that'll take a long time to administer, so I'll hang on until they eventually turn up!

Will be taking my business back to thecoffeepod.co.uk.

Not impressed Lavazza!

Final update:
Fourteen working days later my coffee arrives!
I spoke with Lorraine again the previous day (July 17th) who was very apologetic and sent out an extra box of pods FOC as a 'sorry' for the inconvenience. I had also chased the week before and unfortunately another lady I spoke with wasn't so helpful, perhaps Lorraine can offer her some customer service training?.

They somehow got my address so monumentally wrong, even though I had entered it correctly when ordering, and my confirmation shows this. There were further delays due to this reason.

They never reply to emails, and it's very difficult to reach them by phone, it just rings out eventually....so frustrating!

I will never be ordering from Lavazza directly again.",a year ago

The coffee is absolutely superb, best taste and everyone who has a cappucino or Latte from my Modo Mio machine agrees. Sorry Nespresso, good but not as good as Lavazza. I often get a Nespresso machine in hotels, so have had lots of opportunity to compare. We also use Lavazza coffee for our B&B busness and the guests often compliement us on the taste quality without knowing what it is. Lavazza is true Italian coffee not like the rubbish you get from Starbucks, so if you don't like the taste, you probably don't like real coffee. Also Lavazza as a company have alway been good for me, no problems, the ony thing I would say is that home coffee machines (from any manufacturer) are not built to last more than about 2-3 years and a repair service would be very welcome. The pressure always ends up blowing the seals. I also recommend buying a separate frother - it's cheaper in the long run and you can froth while the espresso shot is preparing.

It's tucked just off the high street and is technically part of an office building, so it can be easy to miss if you don't know it's there, but it's open to the public and it's quickly becoming one of my favourite spots in Uxbridge to relax over a long lunch. Coffee always seems fresh and well made, the food is made fresh each day and is miles better than anything you'd get off the high street coffee chains. It's pretty spacious and gets lot of natural light so it's a nice spot to post up for a while.

Could maybe use a few cushioned armchairs for the extra comfort factor, Harris and Hoole kinda have the edge on that front; but having the extra personal space alone makes it more comfortable than some of the more cramped high street spots.

If you're an EV owner there is a charger a few steps away, but weirdly it's only for EV taxis, not sure how that works.

All the sauces are genuine of what it says on the bottle.
Order before you sit down and you'll find the friendliest staff offering and catering to what you desire.

Service was efficient, staff new several members of our party and were friendly and welcoming.

We shared a mixture of starters, Calamari Fritti, Funghi Mirele (deep fried mushrooms with garlic butter in breadcrumbs) and Bruchetta.

Some of the party had pasta dishes (portions seemed very generous) and the pizza looked good.  Also we had Scaloppine al Limone - scallop of veal in butter and lemon sauce, very delicious and again a very generous portion and Halibut in butter and lemon sauce - fish was perhaps a tad overcooked.

On another note, the layout of the Renoir room means you really shouldn't be in the first or last three seats of each row, as the sound of the surround will be too loud versus the screen for dialogue, and you can barely watch the screen without craning your neck.

In all fairness we were told about a 20 minute wait, which seemed ok only to find out that it's not a very comfy place as we had to sit outside on the stool tables. Big mistake as when the food did arrive the plates didn't stay put.
The food wasn't the best, the eggs were solid, and just lacked some flavour, now it wasn't terrible just not the best.
One good thing if you are a traveller is the screens for the train departures but as no trains were running (a strike day and only Gatwick trains leaving)and we still had to wait 25 minutes, it most probably won't matter as you have no chance of getting your food before your train leaves.

It is a small soft play which is dusty in some accessible areas. However my daughter enjoys it, especially now she is over 3, as there are tunnels she can go through into pods she can wave at me from.

I am giving 5 stars for one reason.
Starbucks did so much the last years to improve the vegan choice, removed the plant milk extra charge and the guy who served me was really nice.
I did not like the taste of the flavoured drinks:)
First I tried the Honey & Hazelnut with oat milk. I know honey is not vegan but this drink has a syrup.
Starbucks is using their own oat milk and not Oatly and did not taste as creamy at all.
I could not taste hazelnut or honey flavour it was just very sweet and as usual soooo hot it burned my tongue.
I went back to get another drink instead and this very friendly barista changed it for me. Thank you!
The next drink was the Dark Cocoa & Orange.
This time I asked for soy milk and drinking temperature.
The drink was still too hot to be consumed immediately for me but other might have a less heat sensitive tongue :-)
This drink tasted cocoa and orange but a rather cheap taste, so not for me either and I asked for it to be less sweet and the did put less powder but it was still too sweet.
Maybe next time I just stick with coffee unless someone is telling me how to order these drinks so they do taste nice.
I also ordered a vegan caramel brownie.
Now that was delicious!! and I cannot wait to try the other vegan cakes/ pastries.

There are other branches of Costa in Kingston too but, for the taste of coffee, I think this is probably the best one and they might want to consider sending their baristas to other branches for training purposes so that other branches can catch up :)

It is usually a cosy place too but occasionally they seem to turn on the air-conditioning a little too much given that the temperature outside is already low enough.

The staff members are all kind and friendly. There are plenty of seats both inside and outside. It is also quite fun to spend time in the seat outside as you can enjoy the view of the whole Bentall.

A flat white and a large latte are my personal favourite. If you want a generous amount of coffee/caffein, nothing beats a Costa large (latte/cappuccino) and a picture has been attached for this üòé

That said, I am currently not a great fan of decaf coffee at Costa as the taste does not seem to match that of the normal/caf coffee. I hope they improve on their decaf soon which will make it even better!",10 months ago

This was in December 2023 so no covid restrictions. I understand that maybe you still can't try things but it was a coat. Simple to put on and take off. She wanted me to put it back? Aren't I supposed to want to buy it?

I was shopping with my mother and I told her what she said. My mother went to try out the same coat in front of her (she's petty like that) and she didn't say anything to her.

Eventually a lady came to us but she almost seemed a little annoyed that we were there haha. We asked if they had room for two. The first level was completely full so she ran upstairs to check. At first I didn't understand if it was okay for us to go up or if we had to wait. Then she saw we hadn't gone up and motioned us up but again she seemed kind of irritated.
Upstairs we were seated and placed our order. The food was okay. The fish had a good crisp but the meat inside didn't have much flavor. The fries were okay as well, some were kind of crispy, others kind of soft, but not in a very yummy way, the inside felt kind of dry. Also, I guess having peas on the side is common in England but I didn't love the combination. I didn't mind that much though, it was just the fish and chips weren't amazing.

The people downstairs were cheery and chatty and you can hear it all clearly from upstairs which was fine with me. Overall, the service was kind of slow and not friendly and the food was just okay.

Places on the fish batter coating were soft and mushy...it needed a bit more time in the hot oil.  Still served with almost cold chips and hard peas.   The sauce must have sat out for a while because it was old enough that the top was stiff and had a darker, different color.  Getting served is a challenge but the wait staff are all very polite.  Still, some tables were completely ignored and diners had to get up and ask loudly for help.   Great location right across from Big Ben.  But the downside is that several bicycle taxi providers park right next to the outside dining area.

There hasn‚Äôt had Wi-Fi for months and they‚Äôve had an on going hot water issue for months too which i find insane seeing as surely Wi-Fi and hot water are two very basic facilities a gym should have.

I just don‚Äôt think Southwark have the operational experience to run leisure centres properly. The gym I would say is ‚Äúokay‚Äù but lots of the equipment is poorly maintained and tired. I was using it for mainly for swimming, but have largely given up at this point. There simply aren‚Äôt enough lane swimming sessions - the times are either first thing in the morning, midday, or late at night. Almost all lane sessions are full at least a week out, so you have to be very on top of checking the app every single day to book a week in advance. There is a waiting list and spots do become free, often an hour or two beforehand, but it‚Äôs a really clunky system and you can‚Äôt rely on it. They‚Äôve also closed the pool now several times, often for weeks at a time, without any compensation. So certainly in terms of swimming, unless you‚Äôre making use of the Southwark Resident Free Gym and Swim at the weekends, personally I think membership here is a waste of money as there are other better run pools. If you do take out a membership I strongly advise not selecting the annual option - the discount for paying annually just isn‚Äôt worth it when they keep closing the facilities due to issues and don‚Äôt offer any comp. - at least paying monthly you have the option to cancel your membership more easily.

I said that we like all options with smoked salmon but just no pork to which he said he would speak to the chef. Coming back he said chef is saying we either do classic or vege option. I said I had it 5 months ago at Wimbledon branch and also in Brent cross branch and they actually gave one smoked salmon one for each plus added smoked salmon even in the sandwiches. He insisted that he spoke to chef and can not do anything. I said how come the other branches did it and your chef isn't accommodating our needs. He explained that if the chef took some smoked salmon for us it would affect another person's afternoon tea. I did not like that and said ok. We waited for the coffee and the waiter came again asking if that's ok to order the Vege option to which I said I'm not happy about and he burst out saying I am not dealing with this and walked off. Another member of staff came and dealt with me saying exactly the same that they can not give us smoked salmon unless we pay extra. I said why would we if we already paid for the whole afternoon tea experience. I was frustrated but was not raising my voice and she said I'm raising my voice.i said no I am not and she said I feel like you are to which I said that's how u feel
I can not help you. This is bad customer service you are going to get a bad review. To which she replied "" are you threatening me? "" . I said that's not a threat. I will leave a review because you and your colleague plus the chef are not accomodating and burst out at a customer for no reason

The menu is similar, maintaing many of our favourites (calamari, fritters, padron peppers, steak, etc) and had plenty on offer to satisfy a family of 5, including a range of (some vegan) small plates, kid-friendly options and larger meals. Special mention for the pumpkin fritters, which were so good we had to order twice.
Eating out these days can be quite eye watering in terms of cost, but the menu offers good value, particularly when you consider the quality of food they serve.
The staff were excellent - attentive, knowledgeable and friendly- and the all round good energy of the place, begins with owners Ed and Emily, who deserve so much credit for opening such a brilliant venue that the whole community will enjoy.",3 weeks ago

ChIJSzwgydoDdkgRF5_0mPScfKI,ChIJSzwgydoDdkgRF5_0mPScfKI5,Ken Shin,"Overpriced, long queue, and a very nice muffin but kinda small for its price.

Food - 5 stars for the muffin we got, but most of the other food looks kinda bad, so overall, 4 stars

Service 5 star - it is self-service style long queue but efficient staffs, so I guess 5 stars is alright. I can't expect more when the place is overflowed with customers

Atmosphere is very bad in a busy weekend full of kids chasing of pigeons, then pigeons keep flying randomly and fly to my table to clean up the remaining leftover from the previous table user.....

Total 2 stars for the over-priced and kid/pigeons

Overpriced as in double the usual London price, I would say 10 to 20% more than usual are acceptable.

Clean, basic and nice.

The tea isn't brilliant, it's that cheap premade slop that they squirt hot water into rather than boiling water and using a fresh tea bag, or leaves; I forgot to order hot chocolate or coffee (which is usually a safer bet): I often find that, in these kinds of cafes, the hot drinks are nothing to write home about and are made as cheaply as they can get away with - so tea bags are reused several times, which of course makes the taste of the tea stronger and more 'tanin' like which, some may actually prefer.

The bacon sarnie I had was ok, no butter, only marge - with the taste of the bacon hidden by the huge slices of bread.

ChIJA_jO-LkIdkgR_g-lQLTjVaI,ChIJA_jO-LkIdkgR_g-lQLTjVaI2,Cedric (Cecemf),"Since Covid, I've consciously supported local cinemas, opting to watch all movies in cinema. However, each visit since 2021 has been marred by issues, making the experience less enjoyable. During our recent visit, the HVAC system malfunctioned (again and again), subjecting us to a freezing cinema for a 2hr movie, and we resorted to using our coats as blankets and running to a coffee shop to get a warm drink to warm up. Despite informing the attendant, no resolution was offered. This isn't isolated; even in summer, we endured excessive heat with no remedy. A cinema's appeal lies in the overall experience, including the screen, sound, seats, and, crucially, temperature, constituting 60% of the experience. Discomfort overshadows the cinematic venture, deterring those who might prefer streaming at home. To revive interest in theaters, prioritizing customer experience is vital. Staff training in basic courtesy. Despite my politeness, staff lacked eye contact and meaningful communication, resulting in a disappointing overall interaction.To enhance the cinema experience, immediate attention to HVAC issues and staff training is imperative. A positive customer encounter is pivotal for fostering loyalty.

A member of the public had to go and inform staff that the lights were still on once the film started. I noticed the lense was quite mucky meaning that the picture had marks on it. On top of that I'm aware that the broken lift has been an on and off issue for years now. It just feels like there is no care and maintenance to the place at all.,a week ago
ChIJA_jO-LkIdkgR_g-lQLTjVaI,ChIJA_jO-LkIdkgR_g-lQLTjVaI4,Ben Appleby,Issues with HVAC in screen 4 made a very uncomfortable experience as it was freezing. Staff also forgot to turn the lights off during the first few minutes of the film which completely washed out the picture. Venue was also not very clean and covered in litter.,a week ago

Three queues the longest 30 deep so takes 15 minutes to get served.   Queue pictured ( at peak busy period 9pm ) with no one serving was the shortest.   The one guy there disappeared to get more stock or was spending 3-4 minutes make custom deserts, per customer.   Why not sell pre-packaged food like e.g. cornetto or magnum?    One good thing was that requested refund of 20 quid was given without question.   How is this cinema chain not bankrupt, it's so badly run?",5 months ago

ChIJOefptrAIdkgRhBKcsjYQvEc,ChIJOefptrAIdkgRhBKcsjYQvEc5,Alice Parsh,"The Terrace Wimbledon is a nice bar but it is not Deaf-friendly. My friend reserved an area for 40-50 Deaf people for a 30th birthday party. On arrival, first impressions were good - the bar is beautifully decorated and had a nice atmosphere. We arrived at about 8pm and as it got darker outside, we found the lighting wasn't bright enough for us to see each other's sign language. It was virtually impossible for us to communicate because it got so dark. We discovered that there was a lamp round the corner from where we were sitting which wasn't being used. I saw a member of staff doing some cleaning and asked if we could move it so we could see better. She said that would be fine, but I thought we'd better check with the manager just to be sure. The lady agreed to come with me to talk to the manager so she could help explain what I wanted. When the manager came over and the lady explained, the manager immediately said no. Then I got my phone out to type messages to show him in case he hadn't understood what I meant. I explained that it was so dark that it was impossible for us to communicate and we needed more light to be able to sign to each other. We just wanted to move a lamp a few meters onto a table for us all to sit round. We were a big group that had reserved an area, and we represented a lot of profit potential. He still said no outright and was not at all interested in trying to help us. We were really disappointed with his rude attitude and his refusal to offer a compromise. We had to give up and everyone left after only a couple of hours, which was such a shame.

This is not a Deaf-friendly place. It's fine for hearing people or blind people, as there's music, a nice atmosphere and the dim light isn't a problem for them. The Deaf community should avoid going to the Terrace Wimbledon as the staff clearly are not interested in helping resolve problems for us and not interested in our custom.",6 years ago

On another occasion however, a staff member was particularly attentive and pleasant, but this was also an exception.

In recent months I have also found their coffee strangely different and inferior to other Cafe Nero's and I always order the same bog standard thing - but here is consistently more bitter, tastes burnt. Perhaps they need to servide the machine, or properly train staff on how to brew.

No effort was made to accommodate, just a ""If you do not like I'll refund you"" (once I'd pointed out the stark anomaly that the customer before had been given a choice).  Customer service like that will not guarantee repeat business, but when you are that way inclined I suppose one simply does not care.

After I paid and my meal was put in a bag, I asked the server for a fork- to which they responded they can only give a metal fork- which requires me to eat in. She said words to the effect of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do plastic cutlery anymore, this is law‚Äù. She repeated this statement multiple times- as though I am not aware of the law. I responded, I understand this- but as a Restaurant who serves takeaway hot food- you have responsibility to source disposable cardboard/wooden cutlery. She continued with the same statements of ‚Äúthis is the law‚Äù multiple times. I explained to her that I understand what the law is, but ‚Äúhow will those who purchase hot food eat outside?‚Äù. I reluctantly accepted the metal fork which required me to eat in, whilst giving it she said ‚Äúso you should‚Äôve said you wanted a metal fork in the first place‚Äù- attitude in effort to look cool in front of the other customers. As I gave her the fork back, I asked for her name as I wanted to provide feedback for her service to the management. She offered her name and I walked away. She yelled asking me to come back and said words to the effect of ‚ÄúI want to take your name also, because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the way you made me feel and even the other customer mentioned if I was okay after you spoke to me. I already told you why we don‚Äôt give plastic forks out, we have a rule that can ban customers from coming here‚Äù. I said ‚Äúwhy do you want to take my name? I spoke rationally and did not once say anything verbally abusive‚Äù- this would be unacceptable. I asked her again why can‚Äôt a restaurant offer alternatives like cardboard/wooden forks- which I obtained from a different costa recently. She finally said ‚Äúbecause we are a franchise, you can complain to the management if you want that to change‚Äù. She did not offer an adequate and rational explanation as to why paying customers can‚Äôt eat with cutlery outside. I as a paying customer just want to know why can‚Äôt I have cardboard/wooden cutlery- I don‚Äôt know why the server just couldn‚Äôt be candid with me. I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased the meal had I known I couldn‚Äôt eat it outdoors in the first place. Also, the mention that I can be blacklisted from this restaurant for making her feel uncomfortable for asking a genuine question- this I consider a threat, and I will be escalating my complaint to head office. I have been supposedly blacklisted from a costa for asking for disposable cutlery. Even questioning is an offence to some.",a month ago

We made a point of buying from a local business rather than sainsburys (5 doors down) which is a shame as I feel like for half the price we might have got what we thought we were ordering.

My wife's panini was OK, but the salad that came with it looked as though it was from 2 weeks ago. We asked the staff if they would eat that, and she just shook her head.

They had burgers on the menu, but unfortunately, they were not available. Compared to what Esquires used to be, this new updated version has univiting decor and will not be seeing me again.

I‚Äôve been going to View Tube for over 3 years and was always a massive fan, however recently they‚Äôve made a change to their tacos and spicy pork cubanos‚Ä¶ which are a little underwhelming üòï. They used to be the best tacos, burritos and cubanos in London. The tacos are very small soft shell (taste like gluten free) and difficult to eat. You have to use knife and fork, not hands. The meat for tacos, burritos and cubanos is now lacking in flavour/seasoning and spice.

I‚Äôm very sad as I came here every weekend for years, but the recipe changes make the food average.

Aside from the food, it‚Äôs decent coffee, good drinks selection (incl. beers & cocktails). Good service. Friendly staff and a fabulous hide away location.

Core ingredients were that standard,  mediocre quality found too often in average breakfast cafes. Pricing was not clear on the day I went ... apparently in-between menu print runs. No boards displayed at till that I spotted. Unusual not to include the drink in the breakfast which added to final cost.

They offer quality produced cooked well and feels light and bright.

It didn‚Äôt blow us away but neither did it leave us disappointed so would likely go again when there‚Äôs often not an appeal to travel intro Central London from where we live. We've already been a couple of times with our most recent visit a week or so ago.

Front of house is now short and rude. Just read the other reviews to see others agree with this. Unfriendly is the vibe now. Senior management isn‚Äôt investigating this.

Now with regards to my order the eggs were so hard. Their excuse, well shocked me. They claim that because the eggs travelled 8 minutes to get to me they can become very hard. What a joke. Hard eggs or hard boiled eggs are not what happens to a poached egg during travel. The chef cannot cook them. Chef used to be amazing!! Now they cannot cook a poached egg. This is so true because we‚Äôve eaten there and been served same hard eggs and also picked up a take away only to eat it across in the park nearby 2 min walk away.

Look at the pictures to see what I‚Äôm talking about.",2 months ago

The wait staff all seemed like in a huff and not very pleasant. The food was okay; perhaps I'm biased because of the poor service but it really wasn't memorable. Had the hash with poached egg and the portion size is generous but the hash is thick and mushy. The coffee was good, mind.

The back garden is a bit tired and stuffy and they've put in a lot of tables and while its tight but doesn't feel very cosy.
